Just completed the first practical class of the internship, and hereâ€™s a sneak peek into what my RStudio looked like during the session! ðŸ‘‡

In this session I explored:

Reading and exploring datasets using "read_excel()"
Creating and modifying dataframes and column names
Installing and using essential packages like "dplyr"
Understanding scriptâ€“outputâ€“environment flow in RStudio
